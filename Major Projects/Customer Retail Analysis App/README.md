This project aims to analyze the shopping behavior of customers in a retail store using machine learning techniques. The project will include the deployment of a machine learning model on the web using Streamlit Cloud. The primary objective of this project is to identify the factors that influence customer shopping behavior and predict their future purchases. The project will involve data exploration, visualization, and analysis, followed by the application of unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms, including K-Means Clustering, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Neural Networks. Additionally, the project will also include the development of a recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering or Content-Based Recommendation Algorithms. The final deliverable of this project will be a web application that allows users to input their shopping data and receive personalized product recommendations.
