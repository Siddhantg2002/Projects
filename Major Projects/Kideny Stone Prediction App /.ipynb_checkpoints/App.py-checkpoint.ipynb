Stent placement can be useful for saving a kidney at risk for postrenal acute kidney failure due to the increased hydrostatic pressure, swelling and infection (pyelonephritis and pyonephrosis) caused by an obstructing stone. Ureteral stents vary in length from 24 to 30 cm (9.4 to 11.8 in) and most have a shape commonly referred to as a 'double-J' or 'double pigtail', because of the curl at both ends.

The specific gravity of urine refers to the electrolytes and urine osmolality.

Then, the proximal convoluted tubule is used for the selective reabsorption of all glucose and some salts and water. The loop of Henle then maintains a sodium gradient, before the distal convoluted tubule makes final adjustments to the amount of water and salts that are reabsorbed.

Thus, the urine has a higher conductivity. Conversely, when the kidney functions is abnormal, the filtration rate of the glomeruli in the kidneys is lower, such that the quantity of these electrolytes in the urine is smaller, thus causes the urine having a lower conductivity.
