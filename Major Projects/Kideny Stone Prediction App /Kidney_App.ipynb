Stent placement can be useful for saving a kidney at risk for postrenal acute kidney failure due to the increased hydrostatic pressure, swelling and infection (pyelonephritis and pyonephrosis) caused by an obstructing stone. Ureteral stents vary in length from 24 to 30 cm (9.4 to 11.8 in) and most have a shape commonly referred to as a 'double-J' or 'double pigtail', because of the curl at both ends.

The specific gravity of urine refers to the electrolytes and urine osmolality.

Then, the proximal convoluted tubule is used for the selective reabsorption of all glucose and some salts and water.
