Text summarization is a very useful and important part of Natural Language Processing (NLP). First let us talk about what text summarization is. Suppose we have too many lines of text data in any form, such as from articles or magazines or on social media. We have time scarcity so we want only a nutshell report of that text. We can summarize our text in a few lines by removing unimportant text and converting the same text into smaller semantic text form.
